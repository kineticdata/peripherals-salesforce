=== Results
This handler returns no results

=== Detailed Description
Updates a Salesforce Contact record when given a contact id and field/values to
update. The first thing that the handler does is obtain an access token using
the inputted info values, which is used to authenticate the rest of the calls
that are made. The parameter inputs are then used to build a Contact object
(only fields that are not empty are included in the object) which is sent to the
Salesforce REST API to update the Contact with those non-empty values. If the
update is successful, no results will be returned from the handler.

=== Where to find the Client ID, Client Secret, Security Token
  1. Go to Setup, which is in the dropdown menu under your name in the upper
     righthand corner.
  2. On the left sidebar, your Security Token can be found under
     Personal Setup > My Personal Information > Reset My Security Token.
  3. To get the Client ID and Client Secret, Navigate back to Setup and go to
     Manage Apps.
  4. Create a new Connected App, and fill in the basic information for the app.
  5. Check the Enable OAuth Settings checkbox and put https://auth for your
     callback url.
  6. Under selected OAuth scopes, add Access and manage your data (api) to your
     selected scopes and save.
  7. Your Client ID and Client Secret will be found on the app information page
     that you were redirected to upon saving.
