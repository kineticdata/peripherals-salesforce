=== Detailed Description

Retrieves a Salesforce Account record with the given Account Id.

This handler essentially has two phases: authentication and record retrieval.

* The handler uses the SOAP API login method to retrieve the authentication
  details that are required for making the REST API requests.  The required
  authentication values are instance and session id, these two values are
  retrieved by the login() helper method in the handler.

* The handler uses the REST API to retrieve the Salesforce record.  The
  handler's return variables are mapped from the Salesforce fields as show here
  (with the name of the Salesforce field on the left pointing to the name of the
  corresponding return variable):
  - Name          => Account Name
