This handler essentially has two phases: authentication and record creation.

* The handler uses the SOAP API login method to retrieve the authentication
  details that are required for making the REST API requests.  The required
  authentication values are instance and session id, these two values are
  retrieved by the login() helper method in the handler.

* The handler uses the REST API to create the Salesforce record.  The Salesforce
  record simply contains mappings provided by the @field_values instance
  variable.  The handler's parameters are mapped to Salesforce fields in the
  node.xml as show here:
