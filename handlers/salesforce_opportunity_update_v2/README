=== Detailed Description
Updates a Salesforce Opportunity record when given an opportunity id and
field/values to update. The first thing that the handler does is obtain an
access token using the inputted info values, which is used to authenticate the
rest of the calls that are made. The parameter inputs are then used to build an
Opportunity object (only fields that are not empty are included in the object)
which is sent to the Salesforce REST API to update the Opportunity with those
non-empty values. If the update is successful, no results will be returned from
the handler.
