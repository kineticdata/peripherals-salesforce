Creates a Salesforce Account record with the given parameters and returns the
Account Id of the created Account record. The first thing that the handler does
is obtain an access token using the inputted info values, which is used to
authenticate the rest of the calls that are made. The parameter inputs are then
used to build an Account object which is sent to the Salesforce REST API to
create an Account with those values.
