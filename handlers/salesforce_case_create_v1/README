This handler essentially has two phases: authentication and record creation.

1. The handler uses the SOAP API login method to retrieve the authentication
   details that are required for making the REST API requests.

2. The handler uses the REST API to create the Salesforce case record. The case record
   contains mappings provided by the @parameters instance variable. The handler's
   parameters are mapped to the Salesforce fields.

== How to Get Security Token
  1. A security token should have been emailed to you on the initial setup of your Salesforce Account.
  2. If you do not have the security token, you can have a new one sent to you:
    a. On the admin dashboard, go to the upper right hand corner
      - Click on your name and select 'My Settings'
      - On the left hand side, go to Personal > Reset My Security Token
        * Click on 'Reset Security Token'
        * An email will be sent to you containing your new security token. Any tokens you had previously
          will be deprecated.
