  The type of object to retrieve (ie. Account, Case, Opportunity, etc).
[JSON Body]
  The Id of the Salesforce object that will be retrieved.

=== Results

=== Sample Configuration
Type:                       Opportunity
Id:                         0060H00000jtPC1QAM

=== Detailed Description
Retrieves a generic Salesforce object given a type and an id and returns a JSON
representation of the object if it is found. The first thing that the handler
does is obtain an access token using the inputted info values, which is used to
authenticate the rest of the calls that are made. The object type and id are
then used to build a REST call that will be sent to Salesforce to retrieve the
object and the results of that call will be used to return the JSON object as
the handler results.
