Disables a user account in Salesforce.

=== Parameters

  Username of the user that you want to disable.

==== Sample Configuration

=== Detailed Description
This handler uses Salesforce's REST API to disable a user in Salesforce. The
first thing that the handler does is obtain an access token using the inputted
info values, which is used to authenticate the rest of the calls that are made.
Next, the handler makes a call to retrieve the user id that corresponds to the
inputted username. One last REST call is then made to Salesforce using that user
id to disable the desired user by setting the IsActive flag to false.
