=== Detailed Description
This handler uses Salesforce's REST API to add a new task to Salesforce. The
first thing that the handler does is obtain an access token using the inputted
info values, which is used to authenticate the rest of the calls that are made.
Next, the handler makes a call to change the requesters email into their user id,
which is what is actually used when assigning a task to a user. Then the task is
made as a JSON object, with the Subject, Opportunity/Account (opportunity and
account cannot be used together), Contact, and Comment values being obtained
from the user inputted data. Lastly, that JSON task object that was just created
is sent in the body of a REST call to Salesforce, where it is then created and
stored in your Salesforce account.

     righthand corner.
