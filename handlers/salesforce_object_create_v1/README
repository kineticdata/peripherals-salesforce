== Salesforce Object Create
Generically creates a Salesforce object given a type and a JSON body.

=== Parameters
[Type]
  The type of object to create (ie. Account, Case, Opportunity, etc).
[JSON Body]
  A JSON object containing the fields and values that should be populated in the
  new object.

=== Results
[Id]
  The Id of the Salesforce object that was created

=== Sample Configuration
Type:                          Contact
JSON Body:                     {"FirstName": "Test", "LastName": "User"}

=== Detailed Description
Creates a generic Salesforce object given a type and a JSON body and returns the
Id of that newly created object if successful. The first thing that the handler
does is obtain an access token using the inputted info values, which is used to
authenticate the rest of the calls that are made. The object type and JSON body
are then used to build a REST call that will be sent to Salesforce to create the
object. If successful, the handler will return the Id of the newly created
object.

=== Finding Salesforce Objects and Fields
  - The SOAP API Documentation is the best way at this point to find the
  Salesforce standard objects and fields
    - Can be found here - https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_list.htm
  - Going to Setup > Customize (under Build) > {Object Name} > Fields gets you a
  list of Field Labels/Names (this view should also show custom fields)
  - Lastly, doing an API retrieve of an already existing object of the type you
  want to create should show all of the fields available on the object (can use
  salesforce_object_retrieve to achieve this)

=== Where to find the Client ID, Client Secret, Security Token
  1. Go to Setup, which is in the dropdown menu under your name in the upper
     righthand corner.
  2. On the left sidebar, your Security Token can be found under
     Personal Setup > My Personal Information > Reset My Security Token.
  3. To get the Client ID and Client Secret, Navigate back to Setup and go to
     Manage Apps.
  4. Create a new Connected App, and fill in the basic information for the app.
  5. Check the Enable OAuth Settings checkbox and put https://auth for your
     callback url.
  6. Under selected OAuth scopes, add Access and manage your data (api) to your
     selected scopes and save.
  7. Your Client ID and Client Secret will be found on the app information page
     that you were redirected to upon saving.
