=== Detailed Description
Deletes a generic Salesforce object given a type and an id. The first thing that
the handler does is obtain an access token using the inputted info values, which
is used to authenticate the rest of the calls that are made. The object type and
id are then used to build a REST call that will be sent to Salesforce to delete
the object if it exists.
