=== Detailed Description
Creates a Salesforce Case record with the given parameters and returns the
Case Id of the created Case record. The first thing that the handler does
is obtain an access token using the inputted info values, which is used to
authenticate the rest of the calls that are made. The parameter inputs are then
used to build a Case object which is sent to the Salesforce REST API to
create a Case with those values.
