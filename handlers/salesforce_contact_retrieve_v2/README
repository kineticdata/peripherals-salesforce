=== Detailed Description
Retrieves a Salesforce Contact's information based on the inputted contact id.
The first thing that the handler does is obtain an access token using the
inputted info values, which is used to authenticate the rest of the calls that
are made. The inputted contact id is then used to build a URL to retrieve the
contact information, which is then formatted and returned as XML results. If the
contact id cannot be found or any other errors are encountered, they will be
caught and raised by the handler.
