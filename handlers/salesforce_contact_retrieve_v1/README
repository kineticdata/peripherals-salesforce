=== Detailed Description

Retrieves a Salesforce Contact record with the given Contact Id.

This handler essentially has two phases: authentication and record retrieval.

* The handler uses the SOAP API login method to retrieve the authentication
  details that are required for making the REST API requests.  The required
  authentication values are instance and session id, these two values are
  retrieved by the login() helper method in the handler.

* The handler uses the REST API to retrieve the Salesforce record.  The
  handler's return variables are mapped from the Salesforce fields as show here
