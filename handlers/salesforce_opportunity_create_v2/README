the Opportunity Id of the created Opportunity record. The first thing that the
handler does is obtain an access token using the inputted info values, which is
used to authenticate the rest of the calls that are made. The parameter inputs
are then used to build an Opportunity object which is sent to the Salesforce
REST API to create an Opportunity with those values.
