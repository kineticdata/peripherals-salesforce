=== Detailed Description
Creates a Salesforce Contact record with the given parameters and returns the
Contact Id of the created Contact record. The first thing that the handler does
is obtain an access token using the inputted info values, which is used to
authenticate the rest of the calls that are made. The parameter inputs are then
used to build a Contact object which is sent to the Salesforce REST API to
create a Contact with those values.
